# Read it to me!

"Read it to me" is a web app that allows you to make the browser read aloud any arbitrary text.

Note: The only browser providing the "read aloud" feature is Microsoft Edge as of December 2023 and it's been so for several years now.

[Open the web app](https://verlok.github.io/readItToMe/) | [Check out Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge/)


## How to use

1. Open the page in your web browser
1. Change the text in the web page! It is fully editable
1. Click the Read Aloud button in the browser bar
1. Eventually change the voice, speed, and language

## Buttons

The two buttons are for:

- **Reset cache**: If you need to use the page again, you might need to reset the Immersive Reader's cache. This button will randomize the page URL, so you'll reset the page cache.
- **Restore initial document**: Restores the document to the initial state.
