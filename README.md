# Read it to me!

A web app to make the browser read any text to you

## How to use

1. Open the page in your web browser (e.g. [https://www.microsoft.com/edge](Microsoft Edge))
1. Change the text in the web page! It's fully editable
1. Enter Immersive Reader mode (F9 on Microsoft Edge for Windows)
1. Click the Read Aloud button
1. Eventually change the voice to read in a different language

## Buttons

The two buttons are for:

- **Reset cache**: If you need to use the page again, you might need to reset the Immersive Reader's cache. This button will randomize the page URL, so you'll reset the page cache.
- **Restore initial document**: Restores the document to the initial state.
